        The **SMPL** started focusing classical system of soft matter since 2010 in Xi'An west of China and now has been a hub for soft active matter research. By exploring bacteria—nature’s tiny machines—we aim to uncover the fascinating physics of sincle cell's life finding its smart way in complex fluids at low Reynolds number.
