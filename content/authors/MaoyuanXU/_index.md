**Bacterial swimming biological fluids**
This project investigates the upstream swimming behavior of _Escherichia coli_ in bile solutions from healthy individuals and patients to elucidate its role in cholecystitis, a gall bladder infection. By employing microfluidic channels filled with clinical bile samples, we measure _E. coli_ swimming speed and orientation dynamics to uncover how the bacterium navigates from the gut to the gall bladder against bile flow. This study aims to establish a mechanistic link between _E. coli_’s upstream motility and cholecystitis pathogenesis, offering novel insights into infection pathways and potential therapeutic targets for gall bladder disease.
