Hao Luo is an Associate Professor in the School of Physics at Northwest University, joining the SMPL lab in 2016. His research interests are on the motion of microswimmers in biological fluids (a key future direction), interfacial wettability control, and evaporation-driven self-assembly. He graduated with a B.S. in Physics from Northwest University in 2011 and earned his Ph.D. in Condensed Matter Physics from the same institution in 2016. Dr. Luo has published over ten SCI papers in journals such as *Physical Review E*, *New Journal of Physics*, *JPCC*,  and *Angewandte Chemie*, and holds four national invention patents. He leads projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China and Shaanxi Provincial Natural Science Foundation, received the “Northwest University Young Academic Talent” award, and teaches undergraduate courses Semiconductor Physics and Open Experimental Physics.
