Yannan LIU (刘亚楠) is a professor of fluid mechanics at the SMPL in Northwest University. She joined in the Department of Materials Physics at Northwest University’s School of Physics as Tenure-track Professor in February 2019. Her research focuses on soft matter physics, biophysics, and fluid dynamics, exploring the morphodynamics of elastic microfilaments in viscous fluids, individual and collective behaviors of active particles, and the interplay between active turbulence and flexible chains. Her earned his Ph.D. in Physics from Université Paris Diderot (Paris VII) in October 2018, studying at the Mechanics and Physics of Heterogeneous Media Laboratory (PMMH) at ESPCI Paris from 2014 to 2018. Dr. Liu has published multiple papers in top-tier journals, including Nature Physics and PNAS, and leads projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Youth Program) and Shaanxi Provincial Natural Science Foundation. He teaches the undergraduate course Fluid Physics.
