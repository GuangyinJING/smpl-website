Multiple degree tracking.

My project aims to develop an advanced multiple degree-of-freedom 3D tracking system integrated with microscopy to precisely capture the dynamic swimming behaviors of _Escherichia coli_ in complex biological environments. By leveraging high-resolution 3D tracking with multiple orientational degrees of freedom (i.e., **pitch angle, polar angle, and rotation angle of flagella**), we enable real-time analysis of bacterial motility, including swimming gaits, flagellar dynamics, and responses to varying fluid conditions and boundaries. This innovative system addresses limitations in traditional 2D microscopy by providing comprehensive spatial and orientational data, facilitating detailed studies of bacterial navigation and adaptation. The project’s outcomes promise to advance our understanding of microbial pathogenesis, such as _E. coli_-related infections like cholecystitis, and hold potential for applications in synthetic biology, infection control, and the development of bioinspired microscale technologies.
