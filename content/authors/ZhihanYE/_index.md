Active nematic topological vortex is a special vortex structure which consist of active nematic particles.Due to the self alignment effect and complex hydrodynamic interactions between particles, this vortex possesses both oriented topological vortex like magnetic vortex and properties of velocity vortex, which two characteristics are coupled and affect each other.However, currently, there is a lack of theoretical research on the specific properties of such vortices based on the hydrodynamic interac-tions between active particles.

Recently, as my small practice project, I am trying to start from the continuum theory of active nematic fluids, we studied how the velocity field characteristics of a two-dimensional nematic active topological vortex are influenced by the orientation pattern, and introduced reasonable stability criteria to provide the conditions for the stable existence of such a vortex.
