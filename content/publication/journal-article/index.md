abstract: Flagellar-driven locomotion plays a critical role in bacterial attachment and colonization of surfaces, contributing to risks of contamination and infection. We propose using biological surfaces composed of vascular endothelial cells to experimentally investigate bacterial motion and interaction behaviors. Our results reveal reduced radii of circular motion on cellular surfaces, two distinct adhesion modes (tight and loose), and enhanced bacterial surface enrichment under flow via a bias-swimming effect, highlighting physical effects in biofilm formation.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Experimental study of bacterial swimming on endothelial cell surfaces, revealing adhesion modes and flow-enhanced accumulation relevant to biofilm formation.
