abstract: "Summer Outing to Guanshan Ranch: A Journey into Nature and FellowshipIn the heart of Shaanxi Province lies Guanshan Ranch, a vast and serene grassland in Baoji that offers an escape from the bustle of city life. This summer, our research group at the Soft Matter Physics Laboratory (SMPL) organized a memorable retreat to this beautiful location. The goal was simple yet meaningful: to embrace nature, refresh our minds, and strengthen the bonds between students and faculty beyond the walls of the laboratory.The journey began on a clear summer morning. As we ascended the winding roads into the mountains, the air grew cooler, and the distant stretches of green pasture came into view. Guanshan’s natural beauty was immediately striking—rolling hills, open skies, and a sense of tranquility rarely found elsewhere. Upon arrival, we were greeted by the fresh scent of grass and a welcome breeze, a pleasant contrast to the city’s summer heat.One of the highlights of the trip was hiking together through the surrounding hills. The trail, though challenging in parts, offered breathtaking views of the expansive grasslands and distant mountain peaks. Climbing as a group fostered a sense of teamwork and mutual encouragement. Along the way, we laughed, shared stories, and took in the peaceful surroundings. The experience was a physical and emotional recharge for everyone.During the afternoon, we gathered to play cards and enjoy casual games in the open field. It was a rare chance for everyone—from new graduate students to senior lab members—to interact in a relaxed setting. In these moments, we rediscovered each other beyond research roles: as teammates, friends, and fellow adventurers. The playful atmosphere lightened the mood and created lasting memories.As the sun dipped below the horizon, the sky transitioned into a canvas of stars. Under this glittering dome, we enjoyed a hearty dinner featuring grilled lamb, a local specialty that was both delicious and fitting for the grassland setting. Sitting together in a circle, we talked about everything—from science and philosophy to family and life dreams. These conversations, shared in the warmth of the fire and the coolness of the mountain night, deepened our mutual understanding and trust.The outing to Guanshan Ranch was more than just a break from routine. It reminded us of the importance of balance in academic life—of stepping outside, looking at the stars, and appreciating the people we work with every day. Such shared experiences help foster a supportive and united lab culture, one where collaboration and friendship go hand in hand with scientific exploration.We returned from the trip not only refreshed but also more connected as a team. The laughter, the hikes, the night sky, and the shared meals will remain part of our collective memory, encouraging us to move forward—together—as a research group, both in the lab and beyond."
